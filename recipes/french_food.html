    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lacy buckwheat pancakes are baked with spinach, mushrooms and cheese to make spectacular galettes. A pancake recipe filling enough for dinner.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>75g buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>250ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>20g unsalted butter, plus extra to grease</li>
        <li>Splash olive oil</li>
        <li>300g baby mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180ºC fan/gas 6. Put the flour in a bowl and whisk in 1 egg, milk and a pinch of salt. Heat a large non-stick pan over a medium-high heat and lightly grease with butter. Add a ladleful of batter (about ¼ of the mixture), swirling the pan to form a large, thin pancake the diameter of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the pancake begin to curl and the underside is golden, then flip and cook for a further 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter, setting the pancakes aside in a pile on a plate.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, melt the 20g butter with a splash of olive oil. Add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 minutes until tender and golden. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute, then add the spinach and lemon zest and cook until the spinach is wilted.</li>
        <li>Put the pancakes on 2 large baking sheets, then divide most of the cheese among them. Top with the mushroom/spinach mixture, then make a space in the middle of each and crack an egg into it. Fold in the edges of each pancake to partially enclose the filling, leaving a gap around the yolk. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese, then bake for 5-6 minutes until crisp, the egg whites are set and the yolks are done to your liking. Sprinkle with extra thyme and serve straightaway with a green salad.</li>
    </ol>
